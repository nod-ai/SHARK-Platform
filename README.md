## Sub-projects

### [`shortfin/`](./shortfin/)

<!-- TODO: features list here? -->

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/shortfin.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/shortfin) [![CI - shortfin](https://github.com/nod-ai/shark-ai/actions/workflows/ci_linux_x64-libshortfin.yml/badge.svg?event=push)](https://github.com/nod-ai/shark-ai/actions/workflows/ci_linux_x64-libshortfin.yml?query=event%3Apush)

The shortfin sub-project is SHARK's high performance inference library and
serving engine.

* API documentation for shortfin is available on
  [readthedocs](https://shortfin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

### [`sharktank/`](./sharktank/)

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/sharktank.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/sharktank) [![CI - sharktank](https://github.com/nod-ai/shark-ai/actions/workflows/ci-sharktank.yml/badge.svg?event=push)](https://github.com/nod-ai/shark-ai/actions/workflows/ci-sharktank.yml?query=event%3Apush)

The SHARK Tank sub-project contains a collection of model recipes and
conversion tools to produce inference-optimized programs.

> [!WARNING]
> SHARK Tank is still under development. Experienced users may want to try it
> out, but we currently recommend most users download pre-exported or
> pre-compiled model files for serving with shortfin.

<!-- TODO: features list here? -->

* See the [SHARK Tank Programming Guide](./docs/programming_guide.md) for
  information about core concepts, the development model, dataset management,
  and more.
* See [Direct Quantization with SHARK Tank](./docs/quantization.md)
  for information about quantization support.

### [`tuner/`](./tuner/)

[![CI - Tuner](https://github.com/nod-ai/shark-ai/actions/workflows/ci-tuner.yml/badge.svg?event=push)](https://github.com/nod-ai/shark-ai/actions/workflows/ci-tuner.yml?query=event%3Apush)

The Tuner sub-project assists with tuning program performance by searching for
optimal parameter configurations to use during model compilation.

> [!WARNING]
> SHARK Tuner is still in early development. Interested users may want
> to try it out, but the tuner is not ready for general use yet. Check out
> [the readme](tuner/README.md) for more details.
