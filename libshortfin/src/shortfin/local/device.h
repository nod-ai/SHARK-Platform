// Each device exists in the local system as part of some topology that consists
// of the following levels:
//
//   Level 0: User device category / system driver prefix
//     (i.e. "hip", "cuda", "local").
//   Level 1: Device instance ordinal.
//   Level 2: Instance topology vector representing the logical organization
//     of the queues on the device instance.
//
// Concretely, this means that each leaf LocalSystemDevice instance consists
// of an iree_hal_device_t (as managed by an iree_hal_driver_t) and a
// single bit position within an iree_hal_queue_affinity_t. The total number
// of devices of a class is thus equal to the product of the device instance
// arity and the arity of the topology vector. There can be at most 64 queues
// on a device instance.
//
// How the topology is laid out is system and use case specific, with multiple
// valid arrangements which may be useful for different kinds of workloads.
// There are some general guidelines:
//
//   * All components of a device with peered memory should share the same
//     Level 1 / device instance.
//   * Whether cross-bus devices should share an instance is use case
//     specific, effectively dictated by the nature of the bus connection
//     and intended use. While an instance can be shared across a lower speed
//     link, it may be advantageous to split it and treat the corresponding
//     device leaves as independent from a memory and scheduling perspective.
//   * The instance topology should generally reflect some notion of locality
//     within the physical architecture of some hardware such that co scheduling
//     at leaf nodes of the vector may have some benefit.
//
// Examples:
//   * Large CPU system with two NUMA nodes:
//     - Split instances on NUMA node: local/2/8
//     - Unified instances for an entire chip: local/1/2,8
//     - Different exotic topologies can be represented with a longer topology
//       vector with machine specific communication cost.
//   * Machine with 8 MI300 GPUs (each with 4 memory controllers and 8
//     partitions):
//     - Split instances per host NUMA node: hip/2/4,4,2
//     - Unified instances: hip/1/8,4,2
//     - Simple 8x partition (ignore memory controller): hip/1/8,8,1
//  * Machine with 8 MI300 GPUs operating as one large GPU each: hip/1/8,1,1
//
// Generally, there is a tension that must be negotiated between how much an
// application cares about the hierarchy vs benefiting from tighter coordination
// of locality. The shape of the instance topology must match among all devices
// attached to a driver.
