// Control object for a resource that is tracked on the timeline. Each such

// as primary (typically corresponding to the lowest numbered queue). This
// object tracks two things about the resource:
//   1. Mutation Barrier: Idle timepoint of the most recent affecting
//      mutation. Since any such mutation mutation must have been enqueued
//      on a single Account, we only need to track the timepoint here
//      (against the account's sem).
//   2. Use Barrier: Fence joined to all timepoints accessing the resource
//      (read and write). At any given time, this represents the point at
//      which the resource has no further pending uses.
// Since TimelineResources are shared (i.e. across subspan storage, etc),
// they are modeled as reference counted (using non atomics, since this is
// "scoped" same thread access). They must only be held in a context that
// is keeping the containing Scope alive.
//
// Note to the future: in discussing the above, many cases were noted where
// a more advanced programming model would be desirable in order to exercise
// more concurrency. However, the conservative default behavior of
// (effectively) reader/writer locks on resources gives solid, understandable
// behavior for a default programming model. It is not meant to be valid
// for everything over time and should not be considered sacred.
