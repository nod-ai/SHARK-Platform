"""This package contains custom operation-like functions which operate on a mix
of `torch.Tensor` and `InferenceTensor` type hierarchies. Available ops
are defined in `signatures`. Specific implementations are in `_impl` modules.

There is a simple `_registry` which allows multiple implementations to be
registered against a signature. Registration is done by type signature. Any
matching implementations are processed in reverse (salience, def order) order.
The first one that does not return NotImplemented is used.

In this way, core operations can be defined over a mix of tensor-like types
and layouts.
