# Flux.1 dynamo exports

### Quick Start

All the exports in this directory are done through `export.py`, with the CLI syntax as follows:
```shell
python sharktank/sharktank/dynamo_exports/flux/export.py --model="flux-dev" --component=<clip/vae/t5xxl/mmdit/scheduler> --precision=<fp32/fp16/bf16>
```
