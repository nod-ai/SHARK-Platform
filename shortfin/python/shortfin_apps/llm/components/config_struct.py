"""Configuration objects.

Parameters that are intrinsic to a specific model.

In a typical transformer model, the KV cache is organized similar to (mapped to
our parameter names below):
    k = tensor.empty(transformer_block_count, batch_size, seq,
                    attn_head_count, attn_head_dim)
    v = ...

For context, a popular model has parameters of:
    attn_dtype_size = 2  # (fp16)
    max_seq_len = 2048
    transformer_block_count = 32
    attn_head_count = 32
    attn_head_dim = 128   # (dim / head_count)

If paging, then we primarily care about the organization of a single block, where
a block represents a single position in the sequence for a single item in the batch.
Therefore, it will be organized like:
    block = torch.empty(transformer_block_count, 2, attn_head_count, attn_head_dim)

In this scenario, we declare that one block holds the KV cache for all transformer
block layers because it reduces the accounting. As such, for the above example,
a single position in the sequence will be 524,288 bytes, assuming a 2-byte element
type. If we choose to block by block_stride=16 positions, each block will be 8MiB.
Assuming we wanted to dedicate 12GiB to the block cache, this would equate to 1536
blocks for a total number of sequence positions of 24,576.

These are well-known numbers but are derived above to give a sense of scale.

In order to indirect through to the block cache, we have to provide the index map
to specific invocations:

* Prefill: Prefill is only writing to the blocks from [0:prompt_len], so it will
    need write indices of [batch_size, prompt_len // block_stride + 1].
* Decode step: Decode is auto-regressive, and needs to first compute the new kv
    row and then attend over all rows in the cache up to this point in the sequence.

If wanting to avoid dynamic allocation of transients, we can also pool the index
tables based on the maximum batch size and maximum sequence length. Since all
block cache sizes are well within the range of an i16, we will use that for storage.
Therefore, each batch invocation would need a block lookup table of:

    byte_size = max_batch_size * (max_seq_len // block_stride) * sizeof(int16_t)

For a max_batch_size of 16, this is 4KiB of block index table lookups per
invocation. We don't have to statically allocate this, but the system is more
predictable if we just reserve what we need. Again, numbers are given to give a
sense of scale only: real workloads will vary.
