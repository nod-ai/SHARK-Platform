# SHARK User Guide

These instructions cover the usage of the latest stable release of SHARK. For a more bleeding edge release please install the [nightly releases](nightly_releases.md).

## Prerequisites

Our current user guide requires that you have:
- Access to a computer with an installed AMD Instinct™ MI300x Series Accelerator
- Installed a compatible version of Linux and ROCm on the computer (see the [ROCm compatability matrix](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/latest/compatibility/compatibility-matrix.html))

## Set up Environment

This section will help you install Python and set up a Python environment with venv.

Officially we support Python versions: 3.11, 3.12, 3.13

The rest of this guide assumes you are using Python 3.11.

### Install Python

To install Python 3.11 on Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt install python3.11 python3.11-dev python3.11-venv

which python3.11
# /usr/bin/python3.11
```

### Create a Python Environment

Setup your Python environment with the following commands:

```bash
# Set up a virtual environment to isolate packages from other envs.
python3.11 -m venv 3.11.venv
source 3.11.venv/bin/activate
```

## Install SHARK and its dependencies

First install a torch version that fulfills your needs:

```bash
# Fast installation of torch with just CPU support.
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
```

For other options, see https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/.

Next install shark-ai:

```bash
pip install shark-ai[apps]
```

> [!TIP]
> To switch from the stable release channel to the nightly release channel,
> see [`nightly_releases.md`](./nightly_releases.md).

### Test the installation.

```
python -m shortfin_apps.sd.server --help
```

## Quickstart

### Run the SDXL Server

Run the [SDXL Server](../shortfin/python/shortfin_apps/sd/README.md#Start-SDXL-Server)

### Run the SDXL Client

```
python -m shortfin_apps.sd.simple_client --interactive
```

Congratulations!!! At this point you can play around with the server and client based on your usage.

### Note: Server implementation scope

The SDXL server's implementation does not account for extremely large client batches. Normally, for heavy workloads, services would be composed under a load balancer to ensure each service is fed with requests optimally. For most cases outside of large-scale deployments, the server's internal batching/load balancing is sufficient.

### Update flags

Please see --help for both the server and client for usage instructions. Here's a quick snapshot.

#### Update server options:

| Flags | options |
|---|---|
|--host HOST |
|--port PORT | server port |
|--root-path ROOT_PATH |
|--timeout-keep-alive |

|--target | gfx942,gfx1100 | gfx942 only supported in this release
|--device_ids |
|--tokenizers |
|--model_config |
| --workers_per_device |
| --fibers_per_device |
| --isolation |	per_fiber, per_call, none |
| --show_progress  |
| --trace_execution |
| --amdgpu_async_allocations |
| --splat   |
| --build_preference | compile,precompiled |
| --compile_flags |
| --flagfile FLAGFILE |
| --artifacts_dir ARTIFACTS_DIR | Where to store cached artifacts from the Cloud |

#### Update client with different options:

| Flags |options|
|---|---
|--file |
|--reps |
|--save | Whether to save image generated by the server |
|--outputdir| output directory to store images generated by SDXL |
