# SHARK User Guide

> [!WARNING]
> This is still pre-release so the artifacts listed here may be broken
>

These instructions cover the usage of the latest stable release of SHARK. For a more bleeding edge release please install the [nightly releases](nightly_releases.md).

## Prerequisites

Our current user guide requires that you have:
- Access to a computer with an installed AMD Instinctâ„¢ MI300x Series Accelerator
- Installed a compatible version of Linux and ROCm on the computer (see the [ROCm compatability matrix](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/latest/compatibility/compatibility-matrix.html))


## Set up Environment

This section will help you install Python and set up a Python environment with venv.

Officially we support Python versions: 3.11, 3.12, 3.13, 3.13t

The rest of this guide assumes you are using Python 3.11.

### Install Python
To install Python 3.11 on Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt install python3.11 python3.11-dev python3.11-venv

which python3.11
# /usr/bin/python3.11
```

### Create a Python Environment

Setup your Python environment with the following commands:

```bash
# Set up a virtual environment to isolate packages from other envs.
python3.11 -m venv 3.11.venv
source 3.11.venv/bin/activate
```

## Install SHARK and its dependencies

```bash
pip install shark-ai[apps]
```

Temporarily, you may need an update to your `shortfin` install.
Install the latest pre-release with:
```
pip install shortfin --upgrade --pre -f https://github.com/nod-ai/SHARK-Platform/releases/expanded_assets/dev-wheels
```

### Test the installation.

```
python -m shortfin_apps.sd.server --help
```

## Quickstart

### Run the SDXL Server

Run the [SDXL Server](../shortfin/python/shortfin_apps/sd/README.md#Start-SDXL-Server)

### Run the SDXL Client

```
python -m shortfin_apps.sd.simple_client --interactive
```

Congratulations!!! At this point you can play around with the server and client based on your usage.
